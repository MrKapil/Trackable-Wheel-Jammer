OVERVIEW = 
Effective transportation and logistics reduce the cost by knowing in Realtime the current location of a vehicle such as a truck or a bus. The Antitheft Wheel Lock Tacking System can be the most efficient tools that can be used to control vehicle encroachment on parking places. With the aim to design and develop GPS based anti-theft wheel lock activity tracker, it can be used to measure the number of vehicles that are found in no-parking zone and ease the funds generation process.

This new system can create many wonders in keeping a track of rule breaking vehicles. It consists of a wheel lock which is a device that is used in situations where it is necessary to inspect a parked car. This hardware is fitted on to the wheel lock in such a manner that it works according to the lock state or unlock state of the device itself. The hardware includes the GPS that is connected to the server and thus it is used as a covert unit which continuously or by any interrupt to the system, sends the location data to the monitoring unit.

When the wheel lock is put on the vehicle, the location data from tracking system and sends the GPS coordinates to the specified server and keeps the traffic police updated about the actions of the vehicle. The status of the lock or unlock state of the wheel lock will help to identify the number of times wheel lock was used, for how much time was the wheel lock in active state and the required location.
